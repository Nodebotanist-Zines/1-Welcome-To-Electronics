# Introduction

## Hi there! 

You might be new to hardware, or you may just be here to see what this Zine has to offer. Either way, we're happy you're here!

This zine is entirely meant for folks who are either completely new to the robotics/NodeBots scene, or those who are at the point of "I've lit up my first LED, now what?" We want to provide a space for people to learn and contribute as we walk this path as a community.

## The Editor

Hi! I'm the nodebotanist! You can find me nearly everywhere with that handle. I'll also be writing many of the articles as I attempt to get this off the ground. Wanna contribute? Take a look at our GitHub \(https://github.io/nodebotanist-zines\) to learn more. The more the merrier!

## Mission Statements

  
This project is being created in order to create more accessible, open, free content to people interested in getting started in hobbyist robotics and NodeBots. We want to bring the community together, swap information, inspire both each other and future NodeBots/robotics inventors. We want to build to diverse community that we want to see in the hardware community at large. And most of all, we want to share and hopefully spread our love of hobbyist hardware in a free and accessible way.
